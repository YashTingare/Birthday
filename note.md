To my best friend,
I'm totally addicted to you-not in a way
that I can't live without you, but in a way
that my days feel incomplete without
hearing from you or message from you.
You bring comfort, joy,
and laughter I never knew I needed.
You've become my safe space,
and life feels better with you in it.
I'm beyond grateful to have
someone as incredible as you by my side.

Our relationship will always be My Priority,
Rishta banaya hai to nibhayenge,
tumse hi ladhenge aur tumhe hi Manayenge!!!...
.........PROMISE..................

Happy Birthday to my Best Friend! 🎉💖

Another year, another adventure around the sun, and I’m so incredibly lucky to have you by my side through it all. From the laughter-filled moments to the late-night talks, to all the crazy and beautiful memories we’ve made, I cherish every second we’ve spent together. You bring so much light into my life, and I honestly don’t know where I’d be without you.

On your special day, I just want to remind you of how amazing you are—how kind, strong, and inspiring you are. You make the world a better place just by being you, and I’m beyond grateful to call you my best friend.

Here’s to another year of laughter, growth, and all the joy that life has to offer. May this year bring you all the happiness your heart can hold and more.

Happy Birthday, Shreya!     You deserve the absolute best today and always. Let’s make this year even more unforgettable than the last. 🥳💕

With all my love,
Yash...Dumb Friend
